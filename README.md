# gists
## My gist files in an independent repository
I had an idea of implementing a `--version` option to a script that would pull its information out of git (if possible).  So I wanted to put my examples in a git repository.

It is possible that they will be become out of sync with [my public gist files](https://gist.github.com/pfuntner/) but we'll see.

### getgists.py

I found [getgists.py](https://gist.github.com/epogrebnyak/c14d6d2ca2740d1e1018e701ea00472a) super useful in pulling down all the files.  It's interesting that each gist is apparently stored in its own repo but I'm going to ignore that.  Once the repos were pulled down, it was pretty easy to move the files of interest into the root directory.
