## My gist files in an independent repository
I had an idea of implementing a `--version` option to a script that would pull its information out of git (if possible).  So I wanted to put my examples in a git repository.

It is possible that they will be become out of sync with [my public gist files](https://gist.github.com/pfuntner/) but we'll see.
